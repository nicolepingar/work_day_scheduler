# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I created this workday scheduler so users can keep track of their meetings & events during the work day. It will conveniently change colors based on the time. Past times are grey, the current time is purple and the future time is pink.  Using JavaScript, this website was built to simplify users' work days. 

## Usage
